## Features

1. Basic Task Management
Add Tasks: Users can input a new task into a text field and add it to the list by clicking an "Add Task" button or pressing the Enter key.
Display Tasks: Tasks are listed in an unordered list format, allowing users to view all their tasks at a glance.
3. Interactive Task List
Toggle Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them. Completed tasks are visually distinguished, typically by applying a strikethrough or changing color.
4. Responsive Design
Adaptive Layout: The design adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the To-Do page is accessible and functional on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
5. User-Friendly Interface
Input Field: A clear and accessible input field for entering new tasks.
Add Button: A prominent button for adding tasks to the list, with hover effects for better interaction feedback.
Clean Layout: The interface is organized with appropriate spacing and alignment, enhancing usability and readability.
6. Dynamic Updates
Real-Time Updates: Tasks are dynamically added to the list without requiring a page refresh, thanks to JavaScriptâ€™s ability to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model).
7. Task Completion Visualization
Styling for Completed Tasks: Tasks that are marked as completed are visually distinct, often using styles like text-decoration: line-through, or changing text color to indicate their status.
8. Keyboard and Mouse Interaction
Add Task with Enter Key: Users can press Enter to add a new task, in addition to using the "Add Task" button.
Clickable Tasks: Users can interact with the list items by clicking on them to toggle their completion status.
9. Input Validation
Empty Input Handling: Prevents adding empty tasks by checking if the input field is empty or contains only whitespace before adding it to the list.
10. Extensible and Maintainable
Easy Customization: The page can be easily customized or extended with additional features such as task editing, deleting tasks, filtering by status (e.g., all, active, completed), or persisting tasks using local storage.
